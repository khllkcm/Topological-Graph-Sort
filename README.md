# Topological Graph Sort

## Input

The input begins with a line containing two integers, 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 and K. N is the number of your tasks (numbered from 1 to N) and K is the number of direct precedence relations between tasks. After this, there will be K lines with two integers a and b, representing the fact that task 'a' must be executed before task 'b'.

## Output

Only print one line with N integers representing the ordred tasks(how you've actually decided to execute them).
